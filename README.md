# JavaScript Quiz Game

## Project Overview
This is a simple, interactive quiz game built with pure JavaScript that runs in the browser. It presents multiple predefined questions, takes user input through a text box, provides immediate feedback on answers, tracks the user's score, and displays the final results — all within a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- 6 quiz questions stored in a JavaScript array
- User input normalized via `toLowerCase()` and `trim()` for fair answer checking
- Immediate feedback after each question (correct/wrong)
- Real-time score tracking and final score display with percentage
- Responsive and modern UI with HTML and CSS
- Enter key support for quick answer submission
- Restart capability to replay the quiz

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for quiz logic and interactivity

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Read each question and type your answer in the input box.
4. Click the submit button or press Enter.
5. See instant feedback and move to the next question automatically.
6. Review your final score and percentage at the end.
7. Optionally, click "Play Again" to restart the quiz.
